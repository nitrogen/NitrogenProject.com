        <p>
        Nitrogen supports some (possibly-confusingly named)
        functionality called continuations. A Nitrogen continuation
        allows you to kick off a function, and then receive a Nitrogen
        postback once that function has completed, where the results
        of the function are posted to the postback.

        <p>
        Additionally, Nitrogen continuations support a timeout
        parameter. When the timeout is exceeded, the postback fires
        with a result of 'timeout'.

        <p>
        Click the buttons below to spawn a few long running
        processes. (They simply sleep for a few seconds and then
        return.)
