        Postbacks allow you to build interactive web applications. You
        can wire a Nitrogen element to listen to any Javascript
        event. When the event fires, the element will post back to the
        <code>event/1</code> function on the calling page (or
        alternatively some delegate module) with the element's tag.
        This allows you to use the power of Erlang pattern matching to
        build an event-driven application.

        Nitrogen postbacks will execute sequentially in the order they are
        pressed, meaning if one postback is taking a while, clicking another
        postback will be delayed until the first postback completes.

%% event/1 is just a function that will end up being called with the term used
%% in an element's postback. You can then pattern match against the passed
%% postback term.
%%
%% Here, we capture the a few of the postbacks that need some special treatment
%% than the rest.

event(textbox_enterkey) ->
    %% Get the value of the textbox with id=my_textbox
    Val = wf:q(my_textbox),

    %% wf:f is a shortcut for io_lib:format/2 (with a few enhancements)
    Msg = wf:f("Enter pressed in textbox with value '~s'", [Val]),
    wf:wire(#alert { text=Msg });

event(checkbox_clicked) ->
    %% Get the value of the checkbox (if it was checked)
    Val = wf:q(my_checkbox),

    %% Checkboxes can be a little *odd* in HTML, a checked box will return a
    %% value (which defaults to \"on\"), and an unchecked box is not submitted
    %% at all, and so will return 'undefined' from wf:q
    Msg = wf:f("Checkbox clicked with value: ~p", [Val]),
    wf:wire(#alert { text=Msg });

event(dropdown_changed) ->
    %% Get the value of the dropdown with id=my_dropdown
    Val = wf:q(my_dropdown),
    Msg = wf:f("Dropdown changed to value: '~s'", [Val]),
    wf:wire(#alert { text=Msg });

event(slow) ->
    timer:sleep(5000),
    wf:wire(#alert { text="Slow process completed! I hope you're still here!" });

event(EventInfo) ->
    %% General postback info that we're going to catch here.  Just capture the
    %% postback and alert the user what the postback tag was
    Msg = wf:f("Postback received with value: ~p", [EventInfo]),
    wf:wire(#alert { text=Msg }).
