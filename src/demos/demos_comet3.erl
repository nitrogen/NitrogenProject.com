        <p>
        This demo shows how to run multiple Comet processes at
        once. Nitrogen automatically merges the results of the Comet
        processes together into a single stream to the client, so the
        only real limit on the number of Comet processes is server
        resources.

        <p>
        In addition, this demo shows how to detect when a user has 
        left the page, shutting the Comet process down gracefully.

        <p>
        Here, we simply cycle through some colors and cardinal
        directions at different intervals.
